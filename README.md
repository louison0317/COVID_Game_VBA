# Covid-game-VBA
An educational Excel VBA simulation game that offers players insights into the complexities of policymaking during a pandemic.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this game, players take on the role of a mayor tasked with formulating policies to combat virus outbreaks in different zones of the city. By adjusting the `alert level` and implementing measures such as setting up `testing stations`, players aim to prevent the epidemic from spreading.

* Each measure comes with its own set of negative consequences. 
> For instance, setting up numerous testing stations may help prevent widespread infection, but it will require reallocating staff from hospitals, leading to a shortage of healthcare workers and an increase in mortality rates. 
> Alternatively, choosing to impose a city-wide lockdown to restrict public movement can effectively curb the spread, but it will inflict significant economic damage. 
> Furthermore, as the lockdown period extends, more citizens may become restless and disobey orders, sneaking outside.

Players must carefully weigh these options and adapt policies over `ten weeks` to make the most suitable decisions based on the prevailing circumstances. 
* Their goal: safeguarding the welfare of their citizens and the city's economy. Ultimately, the player's performance will determine their final score.
