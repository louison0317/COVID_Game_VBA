An educational Excel VBA simulation game that offers players insights into the complexities of policymaking during a pandemic.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this game, players take on the role of a mayor tasked with formulating policies to combat virus outbreaks in different zones of the city. 

By adjusting the `alert level` and implementing measures such as setting up `testing stations`. Meaning while, player have to find a perfect balance between safeguarding the welfare of their citizens and the city's economy.

* Each measure comes with its own set of `negative consequences`. 
> For instance, setting up numerous testing stations may help prevent widespread infection, but it will require reallocating staff from hospitals, leading to a shortage of healthcare workers and an increase in mortality rates.

> Alternatively, choosing to impose a city-wide lockdown to restrict public movement can effectively curb the spread, but it will inflict significant economic damage.
 
> Furthermore, as the lockdown period extends, more citizens may become restless and disobey orders, lead to sneaking outside.

Players must carefully weigh these options and adapt policies over `ten weeks` to make the most suitable decisions based on the prevailing circumstances. 

Ultimately, the player's performance will determine their `final score`.
